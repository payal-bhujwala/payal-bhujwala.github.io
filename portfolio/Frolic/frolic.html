			  	<p>The concept and design for the mobile game was first place winner at the National Institutes of Health’s Shape of Health Competition: An Obesity Prevention Game competition. As part of the winning design, the mobile game is being shipped to iOS and Android app stores and will be made available on June 1st for the general public. </p>

			  	<p>I was onboarded to the team as the Design Lead to help shape and design further iterations of the application, act as the bridge between designers and developers to help ease the hand-off process between them effectively and translate the prototype into the actual running application as well as review and revise design elements and design specifications as needed. </p>

			  	<p>I led the process of creating a wide variety of games focusing on aerobic, muscle strength and bone strength activities which are necessary on a daily basis for girls in the age group of 7 to 12. We also prioritised creating ample numbers of single player and multiplayer games as well as games that could be played either indoors or outdoors. Based on the readability guidelines, we continued modifying the rules to make them accessible for girls between these ages. We reached a total of 100 different games that allowed significant personal, social and physical growth. </p>

				<!-- <img class="align-right slide-in margins-1 img-fluid image-size-cr" src="images/Original Instance.png"> -->

			  	<p>Before the COVID-19 restrictions were imposed on social gatherings, we had the opportunity to conduct two user and playtesting sessions to discover any pain points or unmet needs in the design of the application.</p>

				<p class="insight">From our first session with 2 girls of ages 7 and 9, we uncovered the following pain points: </p>

				<ol>
					<li>The girls <strong class="color-bold">would not want to go over the quiz again</strong> every time they want to select a new game if they have filled out the quiz before already.</li>
					<li>The <strong class="color-bold">timer needed to be less prominent</strong> as it makes the user anxious or nervous.</li>
					<li>In some of the games we were playtesting, we observed that <strong class="color-bold">relevant safety concerns, if any, need to be listed out</strong> before the users start playing. </li>
					<li>The <strong class="color-bold">vocabulary in the application needed to be simplified</strong> and easily understandable by the target age group.</li>
					<li>The interactions were <strong class="color-bold">not consistent with similar interactions on other applications</strong> (ex. The dots indicated a swiping interaction but instead need to be clicked to navigate).</li>
					<li>There was <strong class="color-bold">not enough reinforcement for the badges</strong> to motivate the players to earn more badges. </li>
				</ol>

				<p class="insight">And some of the changes we made based on these pain points were: </p>

				<ol>
					<li>Allowing the user to <strong class="color-bold">return back to the games carousel </strong>instead of having to fill out the attribute selection quiz. </li>
					<li>Made the <strong class="color-bold">timer display less prominent.</strong></li>
					<li>Added safety concern guidelines after the instructions for each game.</li>
					<li>Made the vocabulary simple and <strong class="color-bold">ran the rules through a readability test (Flesch-Kincaid Score).</strong></li>
					<li>Added <strong class="color-bold">Back and Next buttons</strong> provided a clear sense of navigation through the quiz. </li>
				</ol>

				<p class="insight">Our second user test session was with 2 girls, ages 11 and 13, and 2 teachers as it was important to get the adult/parental perspective as well. Some of the pain points we uncovered from this session were: </p>

				<ol>
					<li>Users are not aware of what equipment they will need(if any) to play a game before the games are generated.</li>
					<li><strong class="color-bold">Visual aid did not match the instructions exactly.</strong></li>
				</ol>

				<p class="insight">And the changes we made based on these pain points were: </p>

				<ol>
					<li>Adding the <strong class="color-bold">equipment as an attribute</strong> to be selected in the attribute selection quiz. </li>
					<li>Adding levels for badges so as to make players play a certain number of games to achieve a higher level as a reinforcement factor. </li>
					<li>Making the visual aid match the rule by<strong class="color-bold"> establishing a consistent style throughout all the games.</strong></li>
				</ol>

			  	<p>Because of the pandemic, we could not continue doing further user and playtesting sessions to make design iterations, and thus we made other enhancements to the user interface based on extensive internal critiques and walkthroughs of the user flow. We started off by developing an onboarding sequence with the user signing up to create their user profile and adding profiles for their children.</p>

			  	<p>We fleshed out the parent view allowing the parents to view their child’s activity on a weekly basis and add any external activity that they could have done either during their gym class or otherwise and record that in the app as well. We also added the functionality of playing games from the parent profile directly and allowing the parents to track that data as well when they are interacting with their kids.</p>

			  	<p>We developed the user flow for the badges by showing a progress bar to give the users visibility into what they can achieve as well as show the games that contributed to a badge to encourage the user to play more games.</p>

			<div class="sub-content">
				<img class="align-right slide-in margins-1 img-fluid image-size-cr" src="images/Original Instance.png">

			  	<p>We are still in the process of preparing for the release by finalizing the user flow and ironing out specific details and interactions with the tech team as well as iterating on the language of the application to make it more understandable for our target age group. Prioritising the release date, there are also certain features of the application that have been put on hold for this version but would be implemented in a later version such as:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Giving the parent user recommendations based on their child’s activity ex. Recommending more muscle strengthening games if the child has played enough aerobic and bone strengthening games for the day.</li>
					<li>Adding a ‘Remember Me’ feature which remembers the user’s id once they logout from the application.</li>
					<li>Adding a “challenge yourself” feature to provide the user with a more challenging way to complete the game. </li>
				</ol>
