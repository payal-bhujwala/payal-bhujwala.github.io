			  	<p>We were broadly researching waste management, learning about landfills, toxic waste, food waste, and reusing waste which kindled our interest in sustainability. As we delved deeper into sustainability, we realized we could have a greater impact if we constricted our research initiative to sustainability at CMU.</p>

				<p>To understand more about sustainability on campus we interviewed Barbara Kviz, the Sustainability Director at CMU. She gave us a lot of information on certain issues that the university is facing with recycling and composting as well as the ways in which she is working to promote green practices on campus.</p>

				<p class="insight">Some key insights that I generated from this interview: </p>

				<p>We also did Guerrilla Research with a number of students on campus to understand how they disposed waste <strong>and generated the following insights:</strong></p>

				<p>We began with mapping out the Customer and Service Provider Journey and I generated the following insights: </p>

				<p>Based on these insights and understanding of the user’s needs we created three personas. The first persona is a the user of this application, a student who is inquisitive about sustainable living but does not have enough incentive to recycle/compost. The next persona is a Service Provider who wants to create awareness about sustainable practices and wants to reduce buying from third party vendors that supply food in non-compostable containers. The third persona is a Business Provider who wants to generate profit for the institution and is against implementing expensive new initiatives. </p>

				<p>We began by generating potential use case scenarios where the application can be used. We then narrowed down on scenarios by voting on ones we thought created more value for our users and used them as basis for creating storyboards. We then carried out speed dating where you test out different storyboards with people who would be the users of this system/design and try to understand what the users’ needs are and what do they relate to the most. We zeroed down on the storyboard below because users’ found this most aligned with their interests as well as something they were more likely to use.</p>

				<p class="insight">From this activity I gathered the following insights: </p>

				<p>Based on all the feedback we received about how users wanted to see the impact of their composting/recycling and how they wanted to see it affecting them directly, the final direction that we chose for <strong>our design aimed to achieve the following user needs:</strong></p>

			  	<p>The main purpose of this project was to design a system that creates value for its users. We discovered that our proposal indeed brought back value to its customers and persuaded them to contribute more responsibly to the system as it directly impacted them by rewarding them with dining credit. This would increase their motivation to compost or recycle and in turn, added more value to the Service Provider and Business Owner.</p>

			  	<p>As a project requirement, we needed to ‘pitch’ our idea to a client in front of the class. We received positive feedback after our pitch that the problem we were tackling was very relatable and did not currently have an effective solution in place. However, we are curious to see if a system like this actually creates an impact for its users and whether it incentivises composting on campus. One critique that we also received was that students might exploit the rewards program and not actually dispose of the waste after scanning it. It would be beneficial to have a feedback mechanism to check that the waste has been correctly disposed of for the benefit of the CMU community. </p>

				<p>With this design process, I’ve learned how to identify a problem, conduct relevant research, synthesize the results towards a defined direction, and iterate on a responsive design. This project tied together the skills I had been working on in previous projects as well as other classes, and allowed me to work on a comprehensive, full development cycle design project. </p>
