		  	<p>The idea for this game came after listening to Stuart Candy, a professor of Experiential Futures in the School of Design, talk about his research in this field and also social experiments that he along with his team have conducted that support how the rapid growth in technology has made us more and more ignorant of our reckless consumption of natural resources.</p>

			<p>Adding to this, we decided to design a game using persuasive design principles that allowed users to be more aware of their choices and thereby hope to bring about an attitudinal change in them. We focused on one particular form of natural resource which I will not be giving away in order to keep the embedded design principle intact as well as allow you to discover it for yourself if you do play the game(which is linked below).</p>

			<p>We first began by brainstorming different ideas in the following categories: Content/Story Ideas, Feeling(of the game), Psychological Theories(ones that were applicable to our needs), Experience format and Audience and generated overarching themes.</p>
